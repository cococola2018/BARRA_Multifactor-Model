# BARRA_Multifactor-Model

Here we are going to construct portfolios using multifactor model for stock selection.

We want to replicate the MSCI index first, which is introduced in the reference material, and then improve the parameters to optimalize 
the portfolios.

Reference materials:

<MSCI_Risk_Weighted_Indexes_Methodology_Sep2017>

<MSCI Top 50 Dividend Indexes Methodology>

<MSCI Select Value Momentum Blend Indexes Methodology>

You can download the above materials from MSCI's website.
